Access modifiers:
Keywords that determine the access of members(fields/methods/constructor)
There are four access levels and 3 access modifier keywords.
1) private 2) default(not a keyword) 3) protected 4)public

1) Private:
    if we use the private keyword with the fields or methods those fields and
    methods are only accessible within the same class
2) Default:
    default is not a keyword if we don't specify any keyword with the fields/methods
    default access is automatically applied by Java. That  means that field or method is
    accessible within the same package.
3) Protected:
    if we use the protected keyword that field/method is accessible within same
    class within same package outside of same package, but we have to write extends
    keyword, and we can only access it without creating an object of that class.
4) Public:
    public means accessible throughout project with or without creating an
    object of that class

Class Constructors and this keyword
Constructor is very similar to a method may or may not return something
but constructors always never returns anything not even void.
1) we use constructors to give initial values to fields of class
2) constructors always have same names as class name while methods can have
any names
EXAMPLE:
Person{
String name;
String address;
int age;
String country;
Person(){
sou"Inside the person class constructor
(this code will be executed automatically when we create the object of the class)"
}
}
we can have multiple constructors to ease the creation of object
when we have multiple constructors' java will decide based on the type and the number of
arguments that we are passing when we are creating an object. If we are passing 3 values Java will search
for a constructor that tames 3 parameters, and it will initialize your object with that constructor.
