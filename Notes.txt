File Handling:
Reading and writing data to files using different java classes.
like FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, Properties, and XSSFWorkBook.
FileInputStream is used to read the data from a file and
FileOutputStream is used to write the data to the file.
Notes:
Before we write the data to any file we should always load the data
from that file first otherwise it will be overwritten.
