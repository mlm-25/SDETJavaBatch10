Instance Variables:
    variables which are declared outside a method, loop, constructor or
    a block of code but inside a class without static keyword are called instance variables.
    we call them instance variables because for each object of that class a new copy of the variables
    is created in memory.
When to Use:
    when a value is expected to change form object to object we should declare an instance variable for
    those values.
Static Variables:
    instance variables with static keyword are called static variables. They are called class level variables
    because their value stays the same across all objects and only one memory location is created from the main
    memory.
When to Use:
    when a value is expected to stay the same, when we have to share something
    across all the objects - we should store this info in a static variable.
    Mostly it's used as constance.
    As a good practice we should access it using the class names.

Local variables:
    variables which are declared inside a method or loop or switch case or any block of
    code are called local variables.
    we cannot use static keyword with local variables.
    Local variables occupy the memory in computer for the shortest period of
    time.

Static Methods:
    We can have static methods as well but static methods can not access instance variables
    while non-static methods can access static as well as not static or instance variables.
