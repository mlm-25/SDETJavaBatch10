Constructors:
    Is a special block of code that helps us build/initialize(give initial values to fields)
    our objects. When we write new className(); the code inside the constructor is executed.
    When we do not provide a constructor a default constructor is provided by compiler.
    If we have multiple constructors' java will get the number of arguments and type of
    arguments to decide which constructor to execute.
    If we have the same number of parameters their data types are also same
    we will get an error as now Java not decide which constructor to call.
This()
    this keyword when used with parenthesis calls the constructor of class which constructor to call
    is decided based on the data type of arguments that we are passing.
    It helps us reduce duplicate as n real life projects we might be writing a lots of constructors
