"this" keyword:
We can use this keyword to differentiate between local and instance variables.
class car{
String make;
String model;
int year;
Car(String make, String model, int year){
this.make=make;
this.model=model;
this.year=year;
}

void int year=2021;
String make ="Honda";
String model="Civic";
System.out.println;
}
"this()"
we can use this() to refer to the contractors of the class
if we have multiple constructors Java will decide based on the parameters
to call
this keyword to call the methods
------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance:
is a mechanism in Java through which we can access all the fields and methods from one class
inside another class
We use extends key word to inherit the properties and methods.
benefits:
we can ovoid code duplication
it improves performance
it reduces amount of memory to run the program
Disadvantages:
Parent child classes are tightly coupled if we make any changes we must update the child class
as well otherwise code may break.
