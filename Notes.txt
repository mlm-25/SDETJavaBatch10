Method overloading in java:
    Method overloading is when we have same name of a method inside a class
    but with different type, number or sequence of parameters.
    We overload methods to reuse code and write cleaner code.

Class Overload{

void hello(){
}
void hello(String name){
//overloading by changing number of parameters
}
void hello(String [] names){
//overloading with different type of parameters
}
void hello(String [] names, String name){
//overloading by changing the number of parameters
}
void hello(String name, String [] names){
//overloading by changing the sequence of parameters
}
}

Method Overloading Rules:
    1) To overload we must have at least two methods with same name inside a class
    2) We cannot overload a method by just changing the return type
    3) We cannot overload by just changing the access modifier
    4) Static methods can also be overloaded
    5) We can also overload the constructor of a class
Var args:
    Is a mechanism in java through which we can handle arrays and multi arguments of same data type
    in a method parameter.
    We can treat the var args same as an array inside the method

void (String ... names){
sout names[0];
sout names.length;
for(int i =0; i<names.length;i++){
sout names[i];
}
}
Interview question:
Can you overload a main method?
Yes, you can overload main method in Java. But the program doesn't execute the overloaded main method
when you run your program, you have to call the overloaded main method from the actual main method.
