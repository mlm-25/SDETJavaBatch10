Map -

Map is an interface that helps us to store the data in the form of key value pairs.


Map is a Data structure(it is a way to store and manipulate the data) that stores keys and
values in the form of pair.

keys and values must be objects
keys cannot be duplicate
values can be duplicate

When to use Map:

when fast search is required because of underlying data structure
when we want the indexes other than natural indexes like integers

Types of Maps:
HashMap - oder is not maintained. but it is fasted. It is not thread safe.
LinkedHasMap - oder is maintained bt it is slower than hashmap.
TreeMap - it always stores the data in a stored from that's why it is slower
HashTable - it is similar to the hashmap it should be used when we have to write the code of multithreading because
it is thread safe, but it is slower than hashmap
