Casting in non primitives:
As we can convert primitive data types with get the help of casting we can do the same
with non primitives.
Rules:
Parent classes are considered big data types in non primitives
we can store the object of a child class in a variable of type Parent.

class Parent{
String name;
void printName(){
}
}
class Child extends Parent{

void myOwnMethod(){
}
}

Parent parent = new Child();
parent.myOwnMethod() //CE error
we can do above assignment, but we can't do the reverse
Child child = new Parent(); // CE error
Benefits of casting:
we can achieve run time polymorphism using casting and method overriding
we can store the objects of all the child classes in arrays or some other data structures
we can write dynamic code to access all those objects and execute the same methods on different objects.
when we store a child class object in a parent type variable we can't call child class specific methods
if we want to call child class methods we can do so, but we have to cast that object first.
It's called run-time polymorphism/late binding.
Final Keyword:
1) final with variables if we use final keyword with variables we can't change their values
2) if we use final with methods we can not override that method in child class
3) if we use final with a class we can not inherit from that class
