Collections Framework:
collection in java is a collection of classes and interfaces that help
us store and manipulate data easily.
ArrayList:
ArrayList is a class in collections framework that helps us store elements based on indexes
we don't need to provide the size upfront, and we have several built-in methods to manipulate
the data
Declaration of Arrays
String[] names={"Hilal", "Dinara"}
String[] names=new int[5]
To declare the arrayList
ArrayList<String> names=new ArrayList<>();
Syntax to store the elements in an arrayList
names.add("Hilal");
names.add("Dinara");
to retrieve the elements we use
names.get(i);
Benefits of Arrays:
1) ArrayLists are not fixed in size that can grow and shrink dynamically
2) Build-in methods to manipulate the data
Properties:
1) maintains order
2) we can add duplicate elements
Common Methods of Collection:
add()=--> Helps us to add the elements in the arrayList
get()=--> returns the elements by index
remove()=--> helps us remove the elements from the arrayList
one requires the index the other one requires the actual object to be removed
size()=--> returns the number of elements that are present in the arrayList.
set(index, object)=--> replaces the element at specified index
Note:
As ArrayList can change their size at runtime we should not use loops if we are
removing/adding something to the list.
Wrapper classes:
wrapper classes are object classes for each primitive data types
they are used with the collections' framework
we can use methods from these classes to convert one datatype to another.
Boxing:
String a primitive into an object wrapper class is called boxing/autoBoxing
if we are using the longer way
Integer number = new Integer(12); // boxing
Integer number2 = 15;   // autoUnboxing
UnBoxing/AutoUnBoxing:
conversion of a wrapper type to primitive type is called unboxing or autoUnboxing
