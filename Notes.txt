"Super" keyword:
Super keyword is only applicable when we have at least two classes that have
parent child relationship if we have duplicate field/ method in parent and child class
we can use super keyword to refer to the parent class and if we do not use super keyword
field/method from child class will be referred.
we can also use super keyword with parentheses to call the parent class constructor so that
we do not repeat that code in all the child classes.
