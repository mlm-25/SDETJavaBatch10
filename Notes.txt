Abstraction -
it is the process of hiding the implemented details and focus on the
functionality

it helps us to divide the workflow in multiple chile classes, and also it
helps us to reduce the complexity of the code

rules for abstraction:
to define the abstract class, we have to use abstract keyword
we can have abstract classes with or without abstract methods
we cannot create the object of abstract class, but we can create the object of
its derived class
we can have public private protected members in abstract class
we cannot have a method as static and abstract in abstract class
we cannot have a method as a private and abstract
