Abstract is a process of hiding implementation details and showing functionality only
Abstract Class:
Abstract class are classes that are declared with abstract keyword they help us achieve
abstraction.
Abstraction helps us divide the work load in multiple child classes, and it helps us reduce the
complexity of code.
Rules:
1) use abstract keyword to define an abstract class.
2) we can have an abstract class with or without abstract methods
3) we must declare a class as an abstract class even if we have a
single abstract method inside it.
4) we can not create an object of an abstract class directly, but we can extend this class
and create the objects of child classes that way we will be able to use field and methods
from abstract class.
5) we can not declare a class as final and abstract because final means' no extension and
abstract means incomplete and some classes should be extended it and complete it.
6) we can have public, private, and protected members in an abstract class.
But in an interface always all the fields are public at static final.
7) we can not have a method as static and abstract at the same time
8) we can not have a method as private and abstract at the same time because private
members do not participate in inheritance, and we will never be able to private method body.
9) we can not have a method as final and abstract.

Interface in java
Interfaces in java are also used to achieve abstraction
Rules:
1) All the fields in an interface are by default public, static, and final
2) All the methods in an interface are public and abstract by default
