Recap:
Abstraction:
Process of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality
to the user is called abstraction in java:
We can achieve abstraction by using abstract classes and interfaces
Abstract:
Abstract class are classes with abstract keyword
1) we can have defined and undefined methods in abstract classes.
2) we can not create the objects of abstract classes directly, but we can create
it indirectly with the help of inheritance.
Interfaces:
are contracts in java all the classes which implement an interface must provide the
implementation for the abstract method in that are defined interfaces or that class
must be declared abstract.
Interface Properties:
all the variables are public static and final
all the methods are public abstract by default
Encapsulation:
Encapsulation in java is hiding the data fields of your class by making them private and
providing the getters and setters to read and write those fields
Encapsulation provides security we can write different validation steps before
values are assigned to the fields of a class. We can also write logic to provide
restricted access to these fields.

Problem with primitive variables
they can only hold a single value at a time.
int a = 10;
we can solve this problem with the help of arrays.
Arrays can hold multiple values in a single variable.
